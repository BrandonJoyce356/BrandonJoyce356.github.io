I've posted in the past on [avoiding mocks in Elixir](/elixir-without-mocks).
I decided to give some more thorough explanation and examples in the form of video.
I had fun with this one.  The video explains common patterns for isolated testing without mocking.
I also quickly cover the [Double](https://hex.pm/packages/double) library that I wrote for building injectable stubs for this kind of testing.
