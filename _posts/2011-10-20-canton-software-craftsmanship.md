Developers in the Canton Ohio area have been interested in getting the community going for quite a while now.  Some of us got together and finally organized something that we're really hoping will take off. Canton Software Craftsmanship is an event/meeting that will occur on the first Monday of each month.  You can get more information at the [meetup website](http://meetup.com/canton-software).

There will be a lot of people to thank when it's all said and done
with but here are a few people who have really helped out so far....

Darrell Mozingo - Planning, Sponsorship, Speaking

John Hoover - Planning
